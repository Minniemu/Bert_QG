[{"context": "Attending to the Baghdad church where he works as a caretaker, Natiq Anwar relives the most horrific experience of his life each and every day.Near the pew where the 66-year-old sits, a scattering of crimson tiles marks the places where churchgoers and clergy died 10 years ago.The sacristy, a tiny room next to the altar, is packed with bad memories. Dozens of worshipers sought refuge here as terrorists laid siege to the church. Many were gunned down, or killed by grenades, leaving behind blood-stained hand prints on the walls. Natiq, as well as his wife and child, were among them.Today, Our Lady of Salvation Church is adorned with the engraved names of those who were murdered on that day -- 51 congregants and two priests.The attack left Anwar partially blinded, his right arm badly injured.Eyes half closed, he looks towards a new addition to the church: A white throne, positioned below a towering collage of the parish's martyrs. Pope Francis is set to deliver a speech here when he arrives in Iraq on Friday.\"I'm extremely happy. I'm very, very happy,\" Anwar said, looking ahead to the visit. Despite his effusive words, the caretaker looks slightly non-plussed. \"I want to tell him to look after us,\" he added, \"because the state doesn't look after us.\"But Anwar will not be among the small gathering of church members to greet the Pontiff here during his historic visit. Because of the pandemic, crowds are being kept away.\n", "answers": [{"answer_start": 17, "text": "Baghdad church"}]}]
